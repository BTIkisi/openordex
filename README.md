# OpenOrdex - Open Ordinals Decentralized Exchange

OpenOrdex is an open source zero-fee trustless Bitcoin NFT marketplace based on partially signed bitcoin transactions

## How it works
The seller creates a partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT) specifying the price of the ordinal.  
The buyer can then sign the PSBT and broadcast it to the network.
